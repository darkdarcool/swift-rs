# Swift.rs

Swift.rs is a Swift lexer (and future parser), and it is meant to be blazingly fast. Also, it's written in Rust, as
every fast thing has to be written in Rust nowadays.

## Why?

For my own educational purposes, and to prove that compliation speed can be improved by leveraging better lexing and
parsing strategies. 

## How?

We use [Oxc \(By Boshen\)](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc) lexer and parsing strategies to build the best possible
lexer and parser for Swift.

## What's the current status?

Very bare bones. Lexer can barely parse a few keywords and identifiers. But it's a start. Parser is also a long time
away.

## How to use?

Don't.
